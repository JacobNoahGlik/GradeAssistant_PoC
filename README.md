# Usage

<br>

## Run the Code

1. Update your credentials to use this code. (step-by-step walkthrough found [here](#Update-Your-Credentials))
   1. Make sure your Google Spreadsheet has a `Rubric` section. ([Here is a sample Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1esS07j_bAnAuJTlzbBSTuUt2BVFOLlRvsmu4IFkPL7U/edit?usp=sharing) you can copy)
   2. Make sure your Google Form has the following questions (`Name`, `Email`, `Phone number`) as questions with identical text as the ones in your rubric so that they can match up when auto-grading. ([Here is a sample Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1srvrl8utwEa7ymMNUWZDBrK02AzbhUJrx3kgoJRZYzM/edit?usp=sharing) you can copy)
2. Set up your environment. (step-by-step walkthrough found [here](#Setting-Up-Your-Environment))
3. Run `python3 main.py` in a python-equipped terminal.

<br>

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Default method

To use the `Auto Package Manager` system, simply run the code without considering packages. The system should automatically detect missing packages and install them.

<br>

### Dealing with `Auto Package Manager` issues?

Try installing packages manually. In a Linux shell/terminal with python3 installed, run the following code:

1. `pip install google-api-python-client==1.7.9`
2. `pip install google-auth-httplib2==0.0.3`
3. `pip install google-auth-oauthlib==0.4.0`
4. `pip install apiclient==1.0.4`
5. `pip install getpass`
6. `pip install replicate`
7. `pip install pycryptodome cryptography`
8. `pip install --upgrade cryptography`

<br>

If issues with packages persist, you may want to remove all packages (by running the code below) and re-install them manually (as shown above in [Dealing with `Auto Package Manager` issues?](#Dealing-with-Auto-Package-Manager-issues)).

`pip uninstall google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib apiclient pycryptodome cryptography`

<br>

## Common Errors

### Unknown Module
1. If the unknown module is 'replicate'
   1. Try running `pip install replicate` again
   2. Try running `pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall replicate` if the above does not work
2. If the unknown module is 'getpass'
   1. Try running `pip install getpass` again
   2. Try running `pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall getpass` if the above does not work

<br>

### 400 Error When Uploading Local CSV to Google Sheets
###### Error will look like this:
```cmd
<HttpError 400 when requesting https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/$Sheet_ID:batchUpdate?alt=json returned "Invalid requests[0].updateCells: Attempting to write column: 26, beyond the last requested column of: 25". Details: "Invalid requests[0].updateCells: Attempting to write column: 26, beyond the last requested column of: 25">
```
This is caused by the default maximum column limit imposed by Google Sheets on your Google Spreadsheet. Make sure your CSV doesn't have unintended commas. If this error persists, you may want to add columns manually.

## Update Your Credentials

1. Download the `credentials.json` file
2. Update the `client-ID` and `client-secret` with your own, given to you by Google when you register an OAuth 2.0 client with Google via Google API Dashboard's [credential manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Go to the [Startup Endpoints section](#Startup-Endpoints) of this readme for a walkthrough on setting up your Google Project credentials.
3. Update the AI token
   1. Go to [replicate's website](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python#authenticate) to create a free account (by linking your GitHub account). NOTE: you get ten free API calls to the AI. You can add a payment method. Using the default settings will charge you approximately $0.000021 per API call. Feel free to set a monthly "Spend Limit" on [their billing page](https://replicate.com/account/billing). Supported models and pricing can be found on [their pricing page in the language models section](https://replicate.com/pricing#language-models)
      1. Model Options:
         1. meta/llama-2-13b
         2. meta/llama-2-13b-chat
         3. meta/llama-2-70b
         4. *meta/llama-2-70b-chat* (**default**)
         5. meta/llama-2-7b
         6. meta/llama-2-7b-chat
         7. meta/meta-llama-3-70b
         8. meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct
         9. meta/meta-llama-3-8b
         10. meta/meta-llama-3-8b-instruct
         11. mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2
         12. mistralai/mistral-7b-v0.1
         13. mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1
      2. The model option is set in the `auto_grader_ai.py` file in the `ai` class, in the `generate_response` static method as the first parameter of the `replicate.stream()` function. You can change it to any other model if you'd like.
   2. Once you have an API token from [replicate's token section on their website](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens): copy the token and run the following in a Python-enabled terminal.
      1. `python3 update.py`
      2. `update_token`
      3. `my_API_token` (make sure to replace `my_API_token` with the token from [replicate's token section on their website](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
4. Update the Google Form ID
   1. Run the update script using the following code in a Python-enabled terminal. 
      1. `python3 update.py [OPTIONAL: Google_Form_URL]` (make sure to replace `[OPTIONAL: Google_Form_URL]` with the URL of your Google form **AND** *skip the 3rd step if you choose to do this*)
      2. `update_form`
      3. `Google_Form_URL` (make sure to replace `Google_Form_URL` with the URL of your Google form **ONLY IF** *you did not add the optional URL in the first step*)
         1. NOTE: You will not see an update as this will be read as a password and will therefore be invisible.
6. Update the Google Sheets ID
   1. Run the update script using the following code in a Python-enabled terminal. 
      1. `python3 update.py [OPTIONAL: Google_Sheet_URL]` (make sure to replace `[OPTIONAL: Google_Sheet_URL]` with the URL of your Google sheet **AND** *skip the 3rd step if you choose to do this*)
      2. `update_spreadsheet`
      3. `Google_Sheet_URL` (make sure to replace `Google_Sheet_URL` with the URL of your Google sheet **ONLY IF** *you did not add the optional URL in the first step*)
         1. NOTE: You will not see an update as this will be read as a password and will therefore be invisible.

# Expected Output

<br>

## Expected Local Output Files

### Default Locations
###### NOTE: These default locations can be changed in the `presets.py` file or by running `python3 update.py --show-all`

1. `submissions.csv` is a file representing submissions downloaded from your Google Form. If the data is incorrect, update your Google Form ID (`python3 update.py`). This file will be uploaded to your Google Spreadsheet in the `Submissions` tab/sheet.
    1. By default, it's located in your `output` folder (`./output/submissions.csv`).
    2. To change, go to `Presets.SUBMISSIONS_LOCATION` (type: `string`)
    3. To change, you can alternatively run `python3 update.py --show-all`
2. `graded_submissions.csv` is a file representing questions that have been graded (ordered by `applicant name`). This file will be uploaded to your Google Spreadsheet in the `AI Grades` tab/sheet.
    1. By default, it's located in your `output` folder (`./output/graded_submissions.csv`).
    2. To change, go to `Presets.GRADED_SUBMISSIONS_LOCATION` (type: `string`)
    3. To change, you can alternatively run `python3 update.py --show-all`
3. `gradebook_report.csv` is a file representing the average grades applicants received on questions that have been graded (ordered by `applicant name`). This file will be uploaded to your Google Spreadsheet in the `Student Gradebook` tab/sheet.
    1. By default, it's located in your `output` folder (`./output/gradebook_report.csv`).

## Expected Google Output Files

The Google Spreadsheet is based on the `Presets.GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` value. The authenticating user **must** have "edit permissions." To update or change the value, run `python3 update.py`, select "update_sheet", and enter the Google Spreadsheet URL.

Below are the three new tabs that the script will upload during runtime.

1. `Responses` contains the responses collected from the Google Form. This is an exact copy of the local `submissions.csv` file with correct formatting (commas where they should be).
2. `AI Grades` contains the grades collected from grading the responses of the Google Form. This is an exact copy of the local `graded_submissions.csv` file with correct formatting (commas where they should be).
3. `Student Gradebook` contains applicant grade averages and other metrics. This is an exact copy of the local `gradebook_report.csv` file with correct formatting (commas where they should be).

#  Possible Considerations for Enterprise Use

1. ### Security
   1. ###### Please Note: We do not believe this to be considered if you run this code on a local machine in your physical possession. 
   2. We save your `Replicate` token locally in the `token.vault` file using a robust encryption scheme (see `secureparsing.py` for more info). Every time the token is read, it is re-encrypted based on the time. The time is never saved. If this security scheme breaks your corporation's "secure storage standards" (SSS), you may want to consider other solutions. 
      1. A possible solution is to write it to your operating system's environment variables instead of a local file. This may obfuscate the retrieval process and make it challenging to leak the token accidentally.
      2. Alternatively, if you run this code on a cloud provider's automation account (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc), you may want to look into their secret storage manager (SSM). They do this for you.
   3. We save your Google `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in an unencrypted json file (`credentials.json`). Depending on your corporation's "secure storage standards" (SSS), you may wish to change this.
   4. The Google OAuth 2.0 token is saved locally in `json` form during runtime. It is **never** deleted after code execution. In theory, an attacker could leverage this old token to generate a new one, but it is unlikely and reduces the general load if saved like we have it set up to be. The most viable mitigation tactic would be to remove the file after runtime if you project the use of this code for an hour at maximum.
2. ### Better AI training
   1. Regarding enhancing AI scores, we recommend editing the `background.txt` file (lines 10 and 12). The following changes will impact the AI's scoring performance for all questions. To alter the AI's scoring of specific questions, modify the rubric for those particular questions.  **Make sure to update the local `rubric.csv` file if you add it to the one on Google Spreadsheets or delete it locally, and the script will automatically download the rubric from Google Spreadsheets.**
      1. Removing instructions like "take into account the flow of the applicant's response and grammar/spelling" will make the AI less stringent with spelling and grammar mistakes. 
      2. Adding text like "Applicants must provide examples from their life experience" will make the AI take points off for missing anecdotes.
   2. We send all data (background, rubric, question, submission) in one message. This can open the system to malicious, prompt engineering attacks, and may reduce the quality of AI responses. A potential mitigation/improvement is training the AI with the background, sending the rubric and question in separate messages, and sending the submission in a final message for grading.
3. ### Improving API call speed (Multithreading)
   1. While grading each question, our code calls the Replicate API and waits for a response before grading the next question. On average, Replicate takes 3 - 5 seconds to reply. Depending on the multithreading scheme, running multiple threads or processes may decrease runtime by 80%—95%.
   2. A more straightforward solution may be to run the code at night or over weekends.
